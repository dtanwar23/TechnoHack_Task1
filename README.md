#### Exploring the data, comprehending its structure and linkages, and gaining insights that can be applied to forecasting passenger survival are the key objectives of EDA using this dataset. With this dataset, frequent EDA tasks include: Data cleaning: dealing with outliers and missing values. Data visualization is the process of making graphs and charts, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms, to show how data are distributed. Calculating a summary statistic, such as the mean, median, or standard deviation. When necessary, new features can be engineered from already existing ones. Examining correlations between variables to find relationships is known as correlation analysis. Analysis of survival rates according to various criteria, such as age, class, or gender. Data transformation: Coding categorical variables and scaling numerical characteristics to prepare the data for machine learning.
